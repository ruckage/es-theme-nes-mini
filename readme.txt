Edited several charcters in the gamelist font to more accurately match the font used by nintendo.
Added 12 new systems

Changed folder colors to match selector bar color as they were black on a black background.  Edited the font to replace the @ symbol with a folder icon, now if you name you folders with an @ followed by a space and then the folder name it will display a little folder icon on the game list. eg instead of a folder named 'Puzzle' you would name the folder '@ Puzzle'.

Updated gamelist font so that the folder icon now replaces the # symbol.  This means if you name your folder for example "# Puzzle" it will be shown with a folder icon and all folders will appear at the top of the list when sorted alphabetically.
